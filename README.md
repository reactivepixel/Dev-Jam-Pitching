## 1. Introduction to Jams and Pitching

#### What is a Jam?

A time-constrained event (often a weekend) where participants create applications or games, typically around a theme or constraint announced at the start.

#### Why Pitching Matters

A compelling pitch attracts skilled team members as it shows that you have refined an idea to the point it is ready for development and should inspire programmers, artists, designers, etc. to help turn your idea into reality. Without a strong pitch you risk working with an incomplete team, alone, or not quailifying for the event.

A well thought through pitch will help define your idea.

> Objective: Equip team leads with the tools to pitch effectively in just a few minutes.

## 2. Understanding Your Audience

#### Who Are They?

Fellow game jam participants seeking projects to join. Some experienced, others beginners. You may even pick up a half formed team from another idea/pitch that failed to attract a whole time.

#### What They Want

- An exciting or innovative dev/game idea.
- A role that matches their skills or offers learning opportunities.
- A clear plan and an organized, enthusiastic leader.

> Takeaway: Tailor your pitch to address these desires and show how your project meets them. Assure that you have the plan that will succeed.

## 3. Crafting Your Plan

#### Define Your Game Idea Clearly

- Summarize the core concept: genre (e.g., platformer, puzzle), gameplay mechanics, and story (if any).

- Tie it to the jam's theme if known, or show flexibility if it's TBD.

> Example: A puzzle game where players manipulate time to escape a haunted mansion, inspired by a jam's theme: rewind

#### Highlight Unique Aspects

What's the hook? A novel mechanic, art style, or creative twist.

> Example: Our game uses gravity shifts as a core mechanic

#### Outline Roles Needed

List specific roles (e.g., programmer, artist, sound designer) and platforms (e.g., Unity, Unreal, Godot).

Describe responsibilities briefly: Programmer: Implement mechanics in C++.

#### Show Leadership and Vision

Share your goals: Win the jam, learn a skill, create a portfolio piece.

Assure feasibility: I'll manage tasks to fit the weekend timeline.

## 4. Delivering Your Pitch

#### Engage the Audience

- Start with a hook: What if you could outrun your own shadow?

- Use storytelling to make it relatable

- Use Visuals (If Possible): Sketches, concept art, or a quick prototype to bring your idea to life

- Keep it concise—aim for 4-5 minutes total

> Example: Here's a doodle of our time-bending protagonist.

## 5. Handling Questions and Feedback

#### Assume Questions Understand

- How does this fit the theme?
- Is this doable in 48 hours?
- What engine/platform/libraries are being used?

> Have short, confident answers ready.

#### Be Open

- Show flexibility: The story's open to team ideas!
- Collaboration attracts joiners, don't sound rigid

## 6. Building Your Team

#### After the Pitch

- Be approachable—smile, invite questions, and chat with interested folks

- Have a clear idea of what you need (skills, vibe)

#### Evaluate Fit

- Look beyond skills to personality and enthusiasm
- Team chemistry matters in a jam

> Example: Are they excited and willing to crunch with us?
